# Cluster Power Failure Project

These scripts were used to estimate sensitivity using resampling of empirical data as described in
"Cluster failure or power failure? Evaluating sensitivity in cluster-level inference" (reference forthcoming).

Scripts used in the empirical investigation can be found in <a href=https://github.com/SNeuroble/cluster_power_failure/tree/master/empirical_study>cluster_power_failure/empirical_study/</a>
.
Please refer to the README in that folder for a guide to running the empirical study.
